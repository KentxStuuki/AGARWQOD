        Collaborative farming focused on cultivation of 10 agarwood seedlings over 5-year period. The project requires an investment of â‚± 150,000. This project highlights the economic viability of agarwood with its strong global demand in the perfume, incense, and traditional medicine industries. This will support sustainable land use and biodiversity, integrate mixed farming systems and maintain a low ecological footprint. This serves as a foundational stage for future agarwood inoculation and harvesting. Offering both economic and environmental benefits while fostering transparent, impact-driven partnerships.
